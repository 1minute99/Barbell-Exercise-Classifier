# Barbell Exercise Classifier

### Project Report
- https://github.com/1minute99/Barbell-Exercise-Classifier/blob/main/main.ipynb

### Objective
- Building a Model that can classify barbell exercises using the time series data.

### Outcome
- Machine Learning Model for classifying Barbell Exercise is successfully built using a Random Forest Model with a high accuracy score(0.996 ~ 0.998).
- The random Fores Model and Neural Network model showed the highest accuracy score(0.996 ~ 0.998) when the models were used with feature set 4 (Basic Features + Sum of Squared Features + PCA Features + Temporal Abstraction Features + Frequency Abstraction Features).
- The model was a bit confused between the Overhead Press and Bench Press, as well as between the Row and Deadlift.

### About the data
- The data is collected using a Meta Motion sensor.
- The data includes accelerometer and gyroscope information.
